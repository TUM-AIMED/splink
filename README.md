## __A Federated, Privacy-aware Tool for Genome-wide Association Studies__

## About
**sPLINK** is a tool set for federated, privacy-aware genome-wide association studies (GWAS). **sPLINK** is based on the [HyFed framework](https://github.com/tum-aimed/hyfed), 
and supports three association tests: chi-square, linear regression, and logistic regression.
