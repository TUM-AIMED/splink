# HyFed Compensator

The compensator component of the HyFed framework obtains the noise values from the clients, performs aggregation over the noise values to compute the aggregated noise,
and shares the aggregated noise with the server. The HyFed compensator has been implemented with Python 3.6 and the Django framework 3.2.
